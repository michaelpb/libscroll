    A block quotation  is a quotation in a written document, that is set off
    from the main text as a paragraph, or block of text, and typically
    distinguished visually using indentation and a different typeface. (This is
    in contrast to a setting it off with quotation marks in a run-in quote.)
    Block quotations are used for long quotations.
